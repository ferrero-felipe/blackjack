# A simple blackjack game
## ... or python object-oriented programming
### ... or the simplest blackjack game ever

So here's the deal _(pun intended)_. This is one of my favourite classes to teach on the Ironhack Madrid Data Analytics course.

The Idea is to show how to deal with a few classes, their attributes, methods (including _\_\_dunder\_\__ methods.) and some inheritance.

I feel that the cards example is very ilustrative and intuitive. Besides, printing the cards on the little boxes is very cool for the first week of class.

I finally decised to make it into a MVP, so I present the worst blackjack game ever.

- Aces are always 1.
- No betting
- Computer intelligence is rudimentar.

Enjoy!

I hope I'll get back to it someday and spice it up.
